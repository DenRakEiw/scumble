# Releasing Scumble

Read this before a release (moved out of CLAUDE.md on 2026-09-27, verbatim; CLAUDE.md keeps the short rules). A release
happens only on the user's word; everything before it may be prepared locally.

## The chain

**Every release:** the CHANGELOG section first, the version in `package.json`, `npm run dist`, exe gates `--offline` on
both backends (0.1.30's list: `dist/gates/gates/rel30-exe*/summary.txt`), push, tag `v<version>`, `gh run watch` the
tag's build, `gh release edit v<version> --draft=false`, then the manual sync (`node tools/manual_sync.js`) and the dev
blog post (the last section here; `time` is the release's `published_at` in German time).

Before the tag: the exe gates `--offline` on both backends against `dist/win-unpacked/Scumble.exe`, each on its own
profile (`bash tools/run_gates.sh <label> --offline --exe dist/win-unpacked/Scumble.exe --tiles on|off <gates>`).

## The release channel, signing and the Store

- Release channel: **GitHub Releases** of `DenRakEiw/scumble` (public since 2026-09-09).
  `electron-updater` reads `latest.yml` there; `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds the
  installer on `windows-latest` and publishes a **draft** release on a `v<version>` tag
  (the tag must match `package.json`); publishing the draft makes it visible to the app.
  **Every release needs its section in `CHANGELOG.md` first**: the workflow builds the
  release body from it through `tools/release_notes.py` and fails the tag build when the
  section is missing, and the app shows the same text in Settings › Updates before you
  restart into the new version.
  First releases are **unsigned**; code signing goes through the SignPath Foundation
  (free for OSS) once the project has a public release and some use, fallback Certum
  Open Source. Azure Trusted Signing is paid and not for individuals in the EU.
  **Before SignPath comes the Microsoft Store** (the user, 2026-09-23: qualifying for SignPath takes
  time, and a user who needs a signed installer should have one meanwhile). An **MSIX** submitted to
  the Store is **re-signed by Microsoft** after certification - no certificate to buy or hold - and a
  developer account has been free since 2025-09 for individuals and 2026-05 for companies (an identity
  check replaces the fee). **It signs only the Store copy: the GitHub installer stays unsigned** and
  keeps its SmartScreen paragraph, and submitting the `.exe` to the Store instead would require the
  publisher to sign it first, so this is a second channel, not a replacement. The build has to be
  `runFullTrust` (an AppContainer package cannot reach `127.0.0.1`, which would cut the app off from
  the user's ComfyUI), must not self-update (the Store updates its copy), and must register MCP by the
  execution alias rather than the versioned `WindowsApps` path, as the AppImage does. To be tested,
  not assumed: the single-instance pipe, the plugin folder and every `%APPDATA%` path (keys, autosave,
  file mirror) under a packaged app's redirection. GPL-3.0 is no obstacle (VLC and Krita are in the
  Store). `docs/CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md` holds the whole decision.

## The dev blog post

- **Every published release also gets a post in the dev blog on the user's website**
  (https://www.denrakeiw.com/scumble/blog; the user, 2026-09-21). The site is the repo `F:\portfolio_web`
  (GitHub `DenRakEiw/Portfolio_vercel`, Next.js, deployed by Vercel). A post is one entry at the top of `devlog` in
  `lib/scumble-posts.ts` (slug `v0-1-NN`, `version`, `date`, `time` = the release's `publishedAt` from
  `gh release view` in German time with its offset, `release` link, title, summary, `body` paragraphs): the
  CHANGELOG section retold in a loose, personal first-person voice, in English like the rest of the site, no
  markdown in the strings; `hub.version` in `lib/scumble.ts` follows the release. Before the post, `node tools/manual_sync.js` (the manual and its reader, docs/PLAN_HELP.md), committed
  with it. `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` and
  `npx next build` before committing. **Who pushes matters: Vercel runs on a free (Hobby) account, which deploys
  only commits of its one owner.** Commit with the website repo's own identity (its local `user.email` is
  `schoenebergde@gmail.com` since 2026-09-25, when the user reconnected the Git account to Vercel: the deploys of
  that address go through, one of `dennis.schoeneberg@me.com` was blocked the same day), never as the `DenRakEiw`
  noreply address this repo uses, and **no `Co-Authored-By` trailer** (a second author blocks a Hobby deploy);
  stage only the files of the post. **Git deploys work again since 2026-09-25** (0.1.29's post went live by git,
  `db4197d`). Read the commit's status afterwards (`gh api repos/DenRakEiw/Portfolio_vercel/commits/<sha>/status`);
  should it say blocked again, deploy exactly that commit with the CLI from a clean export, never from the working
  tree: `git archive <sha> | tar -x -C <scratch>`, copy `.vercel/project.json` into it, `vercel --prod --yes`
  there. Then check the live page (posts are anchors on `/scumble/blog`, `#v0-1-NN`, not pages of their own).
