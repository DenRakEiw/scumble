# Recipes

A recipe is what the Generate button runs. Two kinds, one JSON file each, shipped in
`recipes/` or imported into `%APPDATA%/Scumble/recipes/` (Settings › Recipes).

## ComfyUI recipes (`kind: "comfy"`)

An API-format prompt with one Inpaint Canvas node. The app fills the canvas node with
the editor state (`canvas_state`), the node params (padding, target_size, feather,
multiple_of) and `result_source[_local]`, writes the Settings-panel values into the
listed nodes and queues the prompt with its own client id. The result comes back over
the websocket as `inpaint_result` (the node's stitch writes the patch) and lands as a
layer, exactly like in the ComfyUI node.

```
{
  "id": "flux2_klein_local", "name": "...", "description": "...",
  "mode": "local" | "api",          // which result input the chain feeds
  "canvas": "canvas",               // prompt id of the InpaintCanvas node
  "result": "decode:0",             // "node id:output slot" wired back into the canvas
  "needs": ["InpaintCanvas", ...],  // class types the server must know
  "settings": [ { "index": 1, "node": "unet", "input": "unet_name", "label": "Model",
                  "spec": [["file.safetensors"], {}] } ],   // spec optional: /object_info wins when connected
  "models": { "diffusion_models": ["..."] },                // informational
  "prompt": { "<id>": { "class_type": "...", "inputs": { ... } }, ... }
}
```

`settings[]` are the editor's Settings-panel controls: `index` is the slot (1–8, the
node's `setting_n` outputs), `node`/`input` where the value goes. The control's type
comes from the server's `/object_info` when connected, else from `spec` (ComfyUI's
input spec format: `["INT", {default, min, max}]`, `[["a", "b"], {}]` for a combo).

### Import

Settings › Recipes › Import workflow (or File › Import Workflow as Recipe) reads

- a workflow saved from the ComfyUI UI (`nodes` / `links`, subgraphs included):
  needs a connected ComfyUI for the widget order of every node type. Subgraphs are
  flattened the way ComfyUI executes them (inner ids `instance:inner`), reroutes and
  primitives are followed, muted nodes dropped, bypassed nodes passed through.
- an API-format prompt (Export (API) in ComfyUI, or a prompt the node queued): the
  `result_source[_local]` inputs of the canvas node give the result wiring, inputs
  linked to `setting_n` outputs become settings.
- a Scumble recipe file.

The result input that is wired decides the mode (`result_local` wins when both are).
Setting outputs keep the value the target widget had. The import goes to the user
folder and is selected right away; Remove deletes it, Use selects it.

## Provider recipes (`kind: "provider"`)

One call to an API provider; crop and stitch happen in the app
(`renderer/editor/stitch.js`, a port of the node's `run` / `stitch`), no ComfyUI needed.

```
{
  "id": "fal_flux_fill", "kind": "provider",
  "provider": "fal" | "bfl" | "openai" | "gemini" | "replicate",
  "model": "fal-ai/flux-pro/v1/fill",   // endpoint / model id
  "input": "fill" | "edit",             // fill: crop + mask; edit: instruction on the crop (+ references)
  "settings": [ { "index": 1, "key": "steps", "label": "Steps", "spec": ["INT", {"default": 50, "min": 15, "max": 50}] } ],
  "fixed": { "output_format": "png" },  // parameters sent as they are
  "fields": { "image": "image", "mask": "mask", "images": "image_input" }   // Replicate: the model's input names
}
```

`settings[].key` is the parameter name the adapter sends (fal: passed through by name;
BFL: steps, guidance, safety_tolerance, prompt_upsampling, `endpoint` picks the model;
OpenAI: model, quality, input_fidelity, size; Gemini: model, aspect_ratio, image_size;
Replicate: passed through by name, `model` is `owner/name` for official models or
`owner/name:version`, `fields` names the image / mask / images inputs, files over
256 kB go through Replicate's Files API first).
The key of the provider comes from the credential store (Settings › API providers).

What a provider run does: `prepareCrop` builds the crop like the node (selection bbox
plus context, fill mode, target_size scaling to the multiple, the grown and feathered
denoise mask, "with original" and reference layers as extra images), the main process
(`electron/main/providers/<provider>.js`) makes the request, `finishResult` resizes the
answer to the region (center-crop when the aspect differs), builds the composite mask
(selection with soft edge, or the whole rectangle for Paste = crop), colour-matches
against the ring the composite keeps, and stores the RGBA patch in the file mirror as
`output/inpaint_canvas/n<id>_result_<stamp>.png`; the editor adds it as a result layer
and history entry like a result from the node. Not ported: the ECC alignment of the
result to its surroundings (the node's Align option), Lanczos resizing (the browser's
resampler is used), the Navier-Stokes "border" fill (behaves like "blur").

A hidden `loopback` provider returns the crop unchanged (no key); `tools/smoke_test.py`
uses it to check the crop / stitch path.
