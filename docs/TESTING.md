# Testing: the tools and the known flakes

Moved out of `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-27, verbatim, so the file every session reads stays short. The rules (which tier a
change gets, `--offline`, both backends, the exe gates once per release) stay in `CLAUDE.md` "Working rules" and "Gate
runner"; this file is the reference behind them.

## What each test tool covers

Test with real runs: start `./node_modules/.bin/electron . --remote-debugging-port=9555`
  (9333 is usually taken by the node's headless tab), then `python tools/cdp.py eval|shot|log`
  and `python tools/smoke_test.py` (load, select, generate through the recipe, save,
  then the helpers and exports; `--no-helpers` for the short version) and
  `python tools/commands_test.py` (command core + sample plugin, no ComfyUI needed).
  `python tools/mcp_test.py` talks to the MCP server over stdio through
  `electron/main/mcp/launch.js` (proxy mode while the dev instance runs, headless when
  nothing runs; `--exe dist/win-unpacked/Scumble.exe` for the package, `--direct` for the
  old registration, which the Python client rejects by design).
  `python tools/llm_test.py` checks the OpenAI-compatible upsample endpoint against
  `tools/llm_mock.py` (a mock server it starts itself; no ComfyUI, no key, no local model).
  `python tools/generate_test.py` covers "Generate new" (a base image from the prompt
  alone) against the loopback provider, no ComfyUI and no key needed.
  `python tools/shape_test.py` covers the shape tool: every kind, fill and outline, the
  corner radius, the clip to the selection and one undo step per shape.
  `python tools/size_test.py` covers the size a crop is emitted at for an API run: the
  provider variant's `limits`, the five API size modes, the pixel budget, and that a local
  recipe keeps its `target_size`. Loopback only, no ComfyUI and no key needed.
  `python tools/transparent_test.py` covers the OpenAI `background` parameter: the adapter's
  size rules and parameter set in plain Node, then the loopback provider's transparent
  answer surviving the stitch, "Generate new" with a transparent base, and the pixel floor.
  `python tools/editor_test.py` covers the editor behaviour reported broken in 0.1.5: the
  New dialog's two size boxes and its focus, the click that deselects, the outline that has
  to stay visible on white, and copy / paste of a layer between tabs; since 0.1.31 also the Undo history (rows, jumps, snapshots, depth, the history commands).
  `node tools/helpers_test.js` runs the ONNX modules without Electron.
  `python tools/composite_test.py` compares the GPU compositor against Canvas 2D and two
  stored references in `tools/refs/` (`--update` rewrites them, `--tolerance n` allows n
  levels); run it after anything that touches drawing.
  `python tools/perf_test.py [2048x1152 6000x4000 12000x8000]` is the drawing benchmark
  (synthetic documents in their own tab, no ComfyUI; `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §7).
  `python tools/mem_test.py [12000x8000] [--rounds 4] [--keep]` is the memory walk: a
  document per round, benchmarked, closed and collected, with the private bytes of the
  renderer and of the GPU process, a census of every live canvas and the line that made it.
  Restart the app before every benchmark or memory run. Scripted
  waits must use `setTimeout`, never `requestAnimationFrame`: rAF does not fire while the
  window is hidden, and `drawSoon()` is rAF-based, so a hidden window draws nothing.
  Start the dev instance with the Bash tool's `run_in_background`; a plain `&` job dies
  with the shell.
  `window.editor` and `import("./editor/host.js")` are reachable from the console.
  Only one instance runs at a time (single-instance lock); stop the dev instance before
  starting `dist/win-unpacked/Scumble.exe`. `Stop-Process -Name electron` in PowerShell.

Since then: `tools/document_test.py` / `document_ux_test.py` / `document_perf.py` (gates `document`, `docux`,
`docperf:WxH`, `.scumble` documents), `tools/quit_test.py` (gate `quit`), `tools/metadata_test.py` (gate `metadata`,
what an exported picture says about itself), `tools/tiff_test.js` with `tools/tiff_fixtures.py` and
`tools/tiff_test.py` (gates `tiff`, `tiffperf:WxH`), `tools/canvasonly_test.py` (gate `canvasonly`, the canvas-only
view of item 24: real Tab and Escape presses over CDP; the chrome hidden, the view the window's size, full screen and a
fitted picture while on, the view / rulers / chrome / window put back after; Tab ignored in a text field, a dialog, the
editor's ask and with Shift; Escape cancels a pending transform or an open polygon first and never reaches the editor
when it leaves; a full-screen exit from outside, a tab switch and closing the tab end the view; a window that was full
screen before stays so; it takes the test window full screen and back). Every gate name `X` without a rule of its own
in `tools/run_gates.sh` runs `tools/X_test.py`.

## Known flakes

Known flakes; **re-run before believing any of these**:
- `commands_test.py` hangs after every step has printed `[ok]` (the runner's 420 s timeout, sometimes in
  `Page.captureScreenshot`).
- `editor_test.py` `closed_tabs_are_collected` fails with the last tabs still alive, or against an instance with 50+ tabs
  from repeated runs.
- The live stroke steps (`live_stroke_reaches_the_screen_before_the_release`, `live_stroke_preview_shows_what_the_commit_writes`)
  fail when a real mouse is over the test window (they drive synthetic pointer events), or right after a diagnostic
  instance was closed.
- The marching ants (120 ms) break a screen comparison now and then; steps that compare the screen draw the selection as a
  tint.
- `composite_test.py` once got a 1200 × 794 canvas against its 1200 × 800 reference and then crashed with `KeyError 'bytes'`
  in its own failure message (a test bug, not fixed).
- `node tools/brush_test.js` hung once at exit under load after printing every PASS.
- `editor_test.py` `closed_tabs_are_collected` failed twice in five runs of the editor gate alone on the canvas backend
  (`--tiles off`, 2026-09-17, B item 2) and passed on the rerun each time; the code under it had not changed.
- `editor_test.py` `selection_keeps_its_bounds_through_a_restore_above_1mp` failed once with no message on the canvas
  backend (2026-09-23, after `help` and `assistant` in the same instance) and passed on the rerun in the same order.
- `editor_test.py` `a_settled_read_builds_its_levels_in_the_worker_not_here` failed once with `requested: 0` in some twenty
  runs since the mip chains go through the pool; not reproduced.
- The first exe instance of the 0.1.18 gates failed `a_settled_read_builds_its_levels_in_the_worker_not_here`
  (`requested: 0`, 11 s into the editor gate) and `composite_test.py`'s view (a 1200 × 794 canvas) in the same run; both
  passed on a fresh instance. Two known flakes at once, in the first seconds of an instance: not looked into.
- `perf_test.py`'s magic wand row (whole-image band) read 2.1, 4.0 and 7.0 s in three runs of the same code while ComfyUI
  ran a job; an A/B against the commit before in the same minute read 3.5 s. It is the card, not the code.
- The `commands` primed-cells checks wait up to 3 s for the film panel's own settled flatten; a failure "primed cells were
  left behind" seen once without a mutation was that race.
- The editor gate run alone on tiles takes about 370 s (120 s inside a full run). On 2026-09-18 (the split, stage 1)
  four runs alone failed at four different timing-bound steps (the live stroke with the pointer message,
  `closed_tabs_are_collected` twice with the last two tabs alive, `helper_inputs_read_levels_and_upload_nothing` with
  one upload counted), while the unchanged tree passed once and `closed_tabs_are_collected` alone passed 3 of 3 on
  both trees; not looked into further.
