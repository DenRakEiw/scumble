# CLAUDE.md — Scumble (desktop app)

Read this first, then `docs/BRIEF.md` (vision, decisions, architecture, phases).
`docs/BUGS.md` is the bug list: what is reported and not fixed, and what has to be
measured before anyone writes code. Put a new report there, not in this file.
`docs/NAMES.md` holds the name research, `docs/RUNPOD.md` the Docker template notes.

**Name: Scumble** (decided 2026-09-07). A scumble is a thin, semi-opaque layer of paint
brushed over a dry layer so the one below shows through; that is what an inpaint result
over the image is. Pronounced "skum-bl". Domains `scumble.app` and `scumble.de` were free
on 2026-09-07 (`scumble.com` is taken); the user registers them and checks trademarks
(DPMA, EUIPO, USPTO, classes 9 and 42) before the first public mention. Use the name in
the app, the installer (`Scumble Setup.exe`), the MCP server name (`scumble`) and the
repo; the ComfyUI node keeps its name Inpaint Canvas.

## Who and what

Built for and with DenRakEiw (GitHub DenRakEiw, German-speaking, answers in German).
A standalone desktop editor for AI inpainting: layers, selection by text,
retouch, filter layers, colour match per layer, text, PSD/ORA export. Local rendering
through the user's own ComfyUI, API rendering through fal.ai and direct providers,
SAM/RMBG in-app via ONNX. MCP-capable from the start. Windows first, Linux second.

The editor code came from the ComfyUI custom node **Inpaint Canvas**
(`F:\Comfyui\ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas`,
GitHub `DenRakEiw/ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas`, GPL-3.0). **Since C0 (2026-09-13) `renderer/editor/`
in this repo is the source of the editor** and the node's `js/` is a build of it
(`python tools/build_node.py`, `docs/BUILD_NODE.md`); the node keeps its own `js/host.js`,
`js/inpaint_node.js` and `js/inpaint_bridge.js`. That repo stays the backend node and keeps
living. Read its `CLAUDE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md` (§1–23) and `GUIDE.md` before touching editor
code.

## Decisions already made (do not reopen without the user)

- Shell: **Electron** (identical Chromium on Windows and Linux; `ctx.filter` and canvas
  performance; Node process for `sharp` exports and the in-app MCP server).
- Local rendering: **the user's ComfyUI**, local or remote (RunPod). The app never
  bundles Python/Torch. The node pack must be installed there; the app checks
  `/object_info` and offers to install it via the Manager.
- API rendering: **fal.ai** as the aggregator, plus direct adapters (Black Forest Labs
  Flux.2, OpenAI gpt-image, Google Gemini image) and the ComfyUI API nodes as fallback.
  Keys in the OS credential store via Electron `safeStorage`, never in config files.
  Prompt upsampling runs on the same keys, or on a local OpenAI-compatible server
  (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM, `settings.llm.compat`, no key needed).
- Helper models: **SAM2 and RMBG-2.0 in-app via ONNX Runtime** (DirectML on Windows,
  CUDA/CPU on Linux); model files downloaded into the app data folder **or** read from a
  linked ComfyUI `models/` folder. SAM3 stays a ComfyUI helper (no ONNX export).
- Recipes instead of graphs: the user picks "Flux.2 Klein local", "SDXL inpaint",
  "Flux.2 via fal" etc.; a recipe is a workflow template with a fixed Inpaint Canvas
  node id that the app fills and queues. Users can import their own workflow as a
  recipe if it holds an Inpaint Canvas node.
- MCP: the bridge commands from the node (`js/inpaint_bridge.js`, 46 tools) become the
  app's command core; `app.exe --mcp` runs the stdio MCP server in-process (TypeScript
  SDK); headless = the app without a window.
- Filters move to **WebGL2** (grain, curves, colour balance, LUT as shaders), CPU path as
  fallback; the same code goes back into the node.
- Film names: **keep the real names in the grain presets and the film pack**, own
  parametric values only (no manufacturer LUTs), disclaimer in the preset tooltip and
  the About dialog, never in product name or marketing; lawyer check before a sale.
- Plugins: **JavaScript plugins on the command core** (plugin folders with
  `plugin.json`, filter / panel / action / tool extension points), the film pack is the
  first built-in plugin; Python plugins later, not now. Plan in `docs/BRIEF.md` §5.
- Licence: **GPL-3.0** (decided 2026-09-09; `LICENSE`, `package.json`, About, README).
  The same licence as the node, no CLA, no dual licensing (that is also what the free
  SignPath Foundation signing requires). Only MIT/Apache/BSD/OFL dependencies in the app.
- Release channel: **GitHub Releases** of `DenRakEiw/scumble` (public since 2026-09-09).
  `electron-updater` reads `latest.yml` there; `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds the
  installer on `windows-latest` and publishes a **draft** release on a `v<version>` tag
  (the tag must match `package.json`); publishing the draft makes it visible to the app.
  **Every release needs its section in `CHANGELOG.md` first**: the workflow builds the
  release body from it through `tools/release_notes.py` and fails the tag build when the
  section is missing, and the app shows the same text in Settings › Updates before you
  restart into the new version.
  First releases are **unsigned**; code signing goes through the SignPath Foundation
  (free for OSS) once the project has a public release and some use, fallback Certum
  Open Source. Azure Trusted Signing is paid and not for individuals in the EU.

The session hand-over blocks that used to live here ("Where things stand / stood", 2026-09-09 to
2026-09-16) are in `docs/HISTORY.md`, newest first, verbatim. They are a record, not instructions.

## Where things stand (2026-09-16, late)

**Releases.** **0.1.15 is published** (Latest since 2026-09-16; `latest.yml` on the feed says 0.1.15). It carries C6 (c)
slices 3 to 7a (`CHANGELOG.md` 0.1.15). `package.json` is **0.1.16** with an empty section in `CHANGELOG.md`. Check
`gh release list` before believing any release state written down anywhere.

**Built.** C6 (c) slices 3 to 7a, each with its gates, mutations and measurements in `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C6 ("C6 (c3) and
slice 4 as built", "slice 5 / 6 / 7a as built"). The tile engine is on by default in the installed app since 0.1.13, with a
switch in Settings › Rendering; the canvas backend is the escape hatch.

**Constraints right now.**
- **The user needs their ComfyUI instance** (2026-09-16): no `smoke`, and no gate that forwards to it (`commands`'
  `large_upload_route` uploads through the mirror to a connected ComfyUI), until the user says it is free.
- **A headless MCP instance can block the app from starting** (`docs/BUGS.md`): this repo's `.mcp.json` starts the dev app
  with `--mcp`, which holds the default profile's single-instance lock, and Scumble then shows no window. Stopping the
  `electron.exe ... --mcp` processes fixes it; the missing hand-over is not measured.
- **§C7's memory gate is not met** (at most 300 MB of GPU process per document); the default went on anyway, on the user's
  decision.
- **The node repo is behind** (master 647db5d, before C3). `nodecopy` builds and tests it in a scratch copy; build it into
  the real repo only when a node version is meant to ship.

**What comes next, in order** (`dist/c6map/c/` holds the maps; they are older than the code):
1. **7b is built** (2026-09-16, `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C6 "C6 (c) slice 7b as built", CHANGELOG 0.1.16): a matched layer on
   tiles is matched in the part a pass shows from its tiles; 1144 MB of mirrors and 837 ms of first frame at 1:1 gone at 15k.
2. **7c is built** (2026-09-16, `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C6 "C6 (c) slice 7c as built"): one statistics entry per layer for every
   pass, provisional while chains are in the worker. **The (b) numbers are measured and not yet shown to the user**
   (same section): box means 0.81 levels mean over 32 cases, 5.45 / p99 12 on one textured photo; point samples 0.56, max 8.
3. **7d is built** (2026-09-16, `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C6 "C6 (c) slice 7d as built"): the match in the atlas shader.
4. **C6 (d) is built** (2026-09-16, `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C6 "C6 (d) as built"): the base is `{ ref, px }`, no <img>.
5. **The object tool's bigger change A** (`dist/c6map/c/objects.md` §7 to §9: the image-size label map, the per-object
   shape canvases): ask the user where it goes.
6. **C4 is built** (2026-09-16, `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C4 "C4 as built"): steps on whole tiles, `release()`, exact redo boxes.
7. **The rest of §C7 went as far as it could** (2026-09-16, `docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §C7 "The rest of §C7, as far as it went"):
   docs, `--disable-gpu`, the memory walk (not met: +0.6 to +1.4 GB of GPU process per open 15k document on tiles), the exe
   gates (PASS). **Open, needing the user's ComfyUI:** the node in a real ComfyUI tab and in Firefox, `smoke`, `commands`.
   **Open, needing E5:** the 30k gate. **Next, when the user says so:** a release (0.1.16 has its CHANGELOG section).
8. **Phase R**, Rust kernels (`docs/PLAN_BCE.md` §2b; the crate is in the history at c75c4f1), then **phase E**.

**Housekeeping done on 2026-09-16.** The merged branches `c0-editor-source`, `c2-tiles`, `fix-mask-undo` and `px-spike`
are deleted locally and on origin; the v0.1.11 draft release and its tag are deleted; `dist/` is cleaned (old installers,
gate profiles, `dist/ab`, `composite`, `smoke`). `tools/run_gates.sh` recreates the profiles it needs.

**Still unverified or open:** the ToAPIs adapter has never run against the live API (`docs/RECIPES.md` "Only a real key can verify"); a real SAM2 / RMBG
model has not run on the slice 6 code; the user has not reported back on their own 15k file.

## Gate runner and flakes

`bash tools/run_gates.sh <label> [--strict] [--copy] [--tiles on|off] [--exe PATH] <gates...>` starts a fresh instance on
port 9555 with its own profile (with `test_base.png`), runs each gate with a timeout, and writes logs and `summary.txt` under
`dist/gates/gates/<label>/` (or `$SCUMBLE_GATES`). `tools/close_app.py` closes an instance by its DevTools port
(`SCUMBLE_CDP_PORT`). Gates: `pixels editor composite commands shape brush film glb ailabel size transparent generate log
mcp nodecopy toapis llm`, plus `smoke` (a real Flux run; check `/queue` first, and not while the user needs ComfyUI) and
`perf:<W>x<H>`. Run a change on both backends (`--tiles on` and `--tiles off`); a release also runs against
`dist/win-unpacked/Scumble.exe` with `--exe`, each run on its own profile.

Known flakes; **re-run before believing any of these**:
- `commands_test.py` hangs after every step has printed `[ok]` (the runner's 420 s timeout, sometimes in
  `Page.captureScreenshot`).
- `editor_test.py` `closed_tabs_are_collected` fails with the last tabs still alive, or against an instance with 50+ tabs
  from repeated runs.
- The live stroke steps (`live_stroke_reaches_the_screen_before_the_release`, `live_stroke_preview_shows_what_the_commit_writes`)
  fail when a real mouse is over the test window (they drive synthetic pointer events), or right after a diagnostic
  instance was closed.
- The marching ants (120 ms) break a screen comparison now and then; steps that compare the screen draw the selection as a
  tint.
- `composite_test.py` once got a 1200 × 794 canvas against its 1200 × 800 reference and then crashed with `KeyError 'bytes'`
  in its own failure message (a test bug, not fixed).
- `node tools/brush_test.js` hung once at exit under load after printing every PASS.
- The `commands` primed-cells checks wait up to 3 s for the film panel's own settled flatten; a failure "primed cells were
  left behind" seen once without a mutation was that race.

## Traps worth keeping

**Chromium, canvas, WebGL**
- Chromium applies `UNPACK_PREMULTIPLY_ALPHA_WEBGL` to `ArrayBufferView` uploads too; set both unpack switches explicitly
  before every typed-array upload, or premultiplied tile bytes get premultiplied twice.
- Once at least 100 `getImageData` calls have disabled acceleration and they reach 95 % of all canvases created, Chromium
  makes every new canvas software; a test with a readback after every step can trip it.
- `globalCompositeOperation` `copy` and `destination-in` apply to the whole canvas; a regional use needs `clip()` first (the
  vanishing-layer bug of 0.1.8).
- An OffscreenCanvas clips without anti-aliasing; `drawInto` callbacks allow clips on whole pixels only.
- A canvas 65,536 px on a side draws and reads nothing; 65,535 works. The WebGL drawing buffer caps at about 33 MP whatever
  the canvas size says (filters render in tiles for that).
- A sub-rectangle draw from a very large canvas is not cheap (150 band draws from a 15k canvas cost 30× one whole draw);
  bands only pay when each band's source is small too.
- A `CanvasGradient` belongs to the context that made it; a cached one has to be keyed by the context.
- Skia's CPU raster is not exactly translation-invariant; a GPU readback costs whatever is queued before it; Chromium keeps
  small canvases in software, so a buffer that grew onto the GPU differs from an all-GPU canvas by a few levels.
- `requestAnimationFrame` does not fire in a hidden window (`drawSoon()` is rAF-based), and `img.decode()` never resolves
  there; scripted waits use `setTimeout`, image loads wait for `onload`.
- On a `<dialog>` closed by a real Escape Chromium fires `cancel`, not always `close`.

**Electron and Windows**
- In the main process `process.stdin` never emits `data` from a pipe (read fd 0 with `fs.createReadStream`); Electron prints
  a CR LF to stdout before any JS runs (hence the MCP launcher); a window created hidden stays hidden after `show()`,
  `restore()` brings it up.
- Electron has no `window.prompt`; the editor has its own `ask()` modal.
- Only one instance runs at a time (single-instance lock and named pipe), including headless `--mcp` instances.
- `mcp_test.py --user-data-dir` must come before `--cmd`, which otherwise takes it for its JSON.

**Tooling, shell, git**
- A Bash-tool heredoc with an unquoted delimiter (`<<EOF`) runs every backtick span in its text as a command; quote it
  (`<<'EOF'`) or use the Write tool. Heredocs also turn `\\n` in Python source into real newlines, and long Python heredocs
  fail to parse: write scripts with the Write tool.
- PowerShell `Set-Content` writes a BOM (electron-builder then refuses `package.json`); edit such files from Python.
- Python patch scripts write with `newline=chr(10)`.
- Reusing one commit message file gives the next commit the old message.
- The node's publish action runs on a push only when `pyproject.toml` changes; otherwise
  `gh workflow run publish_action.yml --repo DenRakEiw/ComfyUI-InpaintCanvas --ref master`.
- `tools/run_gates.sh` and the mutation helpers restore only the files they saved; check `git diff --stat` after a mutation
  round.
- A background `grep` loop meant to stop a workflow after a phase does not fire in time; read its journal by hand or give it
  a phase switch in `args`.

**Testing and benchmarking**
- A mutation that is not run against a fresh instance proves nothing: the renderer caches the ES modules it imported at
  start. Close the app, patch, start again.
- Restart the app before every benchmark or memory run; after several large documents the GL path degrades.
- A "before" row that runs after `mipsSettled()` measures a warm document.
- An A/B that flips between rows compares two pictures; compare bytes in one state, with
  `releaseCaches({ mirrors: true, deep: true })` between the reads.
- A benchmark row only measures what its document exercises (the perf stack always carries a filter layer).
- ComfyUI holding the card changes op rows by 3 to 5×; A/B a suspected regression in the same session, with the card freed
  (`/free` on an empty queue) if possible.
- The layers reach the local store through `ed.syncLayers()`; a test that reloads right after a change calls it first.
- `editor_test.py`'s `window.__t` is 600 × 300 by the time later steps run; call `new_canvas` first.

**Tile engine code**
- A copy-on-write copy that takes the original's chain buffer must take ownership, or the last holder writes into it in place.
- A rebuild that asks for chains and then drops them asks again forever; cells are kept per tile version.
- `frozen` too high only costs a copy; too low writes into a shared tile. A release must never let go of pixels the document
  still holds.
- A second walk of the layer stack (like `passStores` beside `drawLayersInto`) is where this design breaks; keep it next to
  `drawLayer`'s branches.

## How the app is put together

- `electron/main/main.js`: window, `scumble://app/` scheme (renderer files) with
  `scumble://app/comfy/*` proxied to the ComfyUI server by `electron/main/comfy.js`
  (auth headers live there; the websocket too, events are forwarded over IPC).
  Same-origin, so `<img>` from `/comfy/view` never taints a canvas.
- `renderer/editor/`: the editor, edited here since C0 and built into the node by
  `python tools/build_node.py` (then `python tools/node_test.py`, commit both repos;
  `docs/BUILD_NODE.md`). `renderer/editor/host.js` is the app side: `api` (fetchApi, apiURL,
  queuePrompt, events) and `host` (recipe, settings targets, generate, autosave, export); the
  node's `js/host.js` answers the same members, and `build_node.py --check` fails when the
  editor calls one that either host lacks. Never edit the node's generated `js/` files.
- Recipes are API-format prompts; `host.queueGenerate` injects `canvas_state`,
  `result_source[_local]` and the node params into the canvas node and writes the
  Settings-panel values into the recipe nodes directly (`settings: [{index, node,
  input, label}]`), so `setting_n` outputs are not used.
- State: every tab's `getValue()` JSON in one bundle, autosaved to
  `%APPDATA%/Scumble/autosave.json` and restored at the next start from the local file
  mirror (`%APPDATA%/Scumble/files/`), no server needed. Layer pixels are uploaded like
  in the node (`input/inpaint_canvas`), but the upload lands in the mirror and is
  forwarded; `ensureOnServer` re-uploads before a run.
- `renderer/shell.js`: tab bar, settings dialog (ComfyUI + auth + Test, API keys,
  recipes, helpers, local files), menu commands, restore at start; exports `newDocument`,
  `activate`, `closeDocument`, `openSettings`, `selectRecipe`, `loadRecipes`,
  `importRecipe`, `testConnection`, `connect` for tests (`import("./shell.js")` from
  the console). `window.editor` is always the active tab.
- Helpers in-app: editor → `host.findObjects` / `host.cutoutInApp` / `host.selectPoint`
  (source scaled to 1024² in the renderer) → IPC `helpers:objects|cutout|segment` →
  `electron/main/onnx/index.js` → `sam2.js` / `matting.js` on the `Runtime` → label
  map / alpha back, scaled to the image in the renderer. Models and folder in
  `docs/HELPERS.md`.
- Agents: MCP client → `Scumble --mcp` (`electron/main/mcp/server.js`) → `AgentBackend` in
  `main.js` → the running instance over `electron/main/local.js` (named pipe) or the app
  started headless in the same process → `electron/main/bridge.js` (IPC `commands:request` /
  `commands:reply`) → `commands.call` in `renderer/shell.js`. `docs/MCP.md`.
- Provider runs: `host.runProvider` (the recipe resolved to the chosen provider's variant by
  `shell.js`) → `renderer/editor/stitch.js` (crop) → IPC `provider:edit` →
  `electron/main/providers/index.js` picks the adapter and the key (`keys.js`) →
  `stitch.js` (composite mask, colour match) → mirror upload → `addResults`. Recipe
  formats in `docs/RECIPES.md`.

## Working rules

- Development folder is `F:\canvas`. Scratch files go to the session scratchpad, not here.
- Commit as DenRakEiw: `git -c user.name=DenRakEiw -c user.email=89697885+DenRakEiw@users.noreply.github.com`,
  no Claude trailer in commit messages. Push with `-c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential'`.
- The user's ComfyUI (port 8188) is a production machine: check `/queue` before
  queueing anything, never restart it unasked, delete own test prompts from the queue.
- Python patch scripts must write with `newline=chr(10)`; a mistyped `newline="\\n"`
  once truncated a 7,000-line file.
- Test with real runs: start `./node_modules/.bin/electron . --remote-debugging-port=9555`
  (9333 is usually taken by the node's headless tab), then `python tools/cdp.py eval|shot|log`
  and `python tools/smoke_test.py` (load, select, generate through the recipe, save,
  then the helpers and exports; `--no-helpers` for the short version) and
  `python tools/commands_test.py` (command core + sample plugin, no ComfyUI needed).
  `python tools/mcp_test.py` talks to the MCP server over stdio through
  `electron/main/mcp/launch.js` (proxy mode while the dev instance runs, headless when
  nothing runs; `--exe dist/win-unpacked/Scumble.exe` for the package, `--direct` for the
  old registration, which the Python client rejects by design).
  `python tools/llm_test.py` checks the OpenAI-compatible upsample endpoint against
  `tools/llm_mock.py` (a mock server it starts itself; no ComfyUI, no key, no local model).
  `python tools/generate_test.py` covers "Generate new" (a base image from the prompt
  alone) against the loopback provider, no ComfyUI and no key needed.
  `python tools/shape_test.py` covers the shape tool: every kind, fill and outline, the
  corner radius, the clip to the selection and one undo step per shape.
  `python tools/size_test.py` covers the size a crop is emitted at for an API run: the
  provider variant's `limits`, the five API size modes, the pixel budget, and that a local
  recipe keeps its `target_size`. Loopback only, no ComfyUI and no key needed.
  `python tools/transparent_test.py` covers the OpenAI `background` parameter: the adapter's
  size rules and parameter set in plain Node, then the loopback provider's transparent
  answer surviving the stitch, "Generate new" with a transparent base, and the pixel floor.
  `python tools/editor_test.py` covers the editor behaviour reported broken in 0.1.5: the
  New dialog's two size boxes and its focus, the click that deselects, the outline that has
  to stay visible on white, and copy / paste of a layer between tabs.
  `node tools/helpers_test.js` runs the ONNX modules without Electron.
  `python tools/composite_test.py` compares the GPU compositor against Canvas 2D and two
  stored references in `tools/refs/` (`--update` rewrites them, `--tolerance n` allows n
  levels); run it after anything that touches drawing.
  `python tools/perf_test.py [2048x1152 6000x4000 12000x8000]` is the drawing benchmark
  (synthetic documents in their own tab, no ComfyUI; `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §7).
  `python tools/mem_test.py [12000x8000] [--rounds 4] [--keep]` is the memory walk: a
  document per round, benchmarked, closed and collected, with the private bytes of the
  renderer and of the GPU process, a census of every live canvas and the line that made it.
  Restart the app before every benchmark or memory run. Scripted
  waits must use `setTimeout`, never `requestAnimationFrame`: rAF does not fire while the
  window is hidden, and `drawSoon()` is rAF-based, so a hidden window draws nothing.
  Start the dev instance with the Bash tool's `run_in_background`; a plain `&` job dies
  with the shell.
  `window.editor` and `import("./editor/host.js")` are reachable from the console.
  Only one instance runs at a time (single-instance lock); stop the dev instance before
  starting `dist/win-unpacked/Scumble.exe`. `Stop-Process -Name electron` in PowerShell.
- Answer in German; code, comments and docs in English.
